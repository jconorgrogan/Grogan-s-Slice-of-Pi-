## Theorem
Let \( R = 2^n \) for some positive integer \( n \). Consider a circle of radius \( R \) centered at the origin. Divide the circle into \( R \) equal slices. Then the y-coordinate \( y \) of the first slice's intersection point above the x-axis approaches \( 2\pi \) as \( n \to \infty \).

### Formula for y-coordinate
\[
y = R \sin \left( \frac{2\pi}{R} \right)
\]

### Convergence
As \( n \to \infty \), \( y \to 2\pi \).
